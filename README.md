# CoolScope
Telescope fan controller

CoolScope v 1.0 is a diy fan controller based on Arduino Nano. It is used to cool down (thermostabilize) the 12 inch Meade LX200 telescope. It is assembed in a 3D pronted case and mounted on the back on the scope.

The project consists of three parts:

Telescope_fans - Arduino sketch source code.
PCB - KiCad files for circut schematcis and PCB.
Case - SolidWorks and STL files of 3D model of the case.
